    \textbf{Overview}\\%
    In Module 1 you committed to becoming a better interpersonal communicator by
      focusing on improving two interpersonal communication skills. In each
      subsequent module, we are checking in to see how those efforts are
      proceeding based on your practice sessions. In this module, you will
      report on how your practice has progressed so far.\\%

    You should spend approximately 4 hours on this assignment.%

  \section*{Instructions}
    Take a few moments to reflect upon your nonverbal communication skills.
      In your Main post, reply to the following questions:

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Do your non-verbals give too much away when communicating?
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Is this an area you need to work on? Why or why not?
      \end{itemize}
      \item As we saw in the movie clip appearing within the topic titled,
        ``The Theme'', Pete and Debbie may be saying one thing, but their body
        language is telling a different story. Tell us about a time when you had
        a similar experience.
    \end{enumerate}

  \newpage
  \section{Initial Post}
    This past week was actually difficult for me to attempt at practicing
      many interpersonal communication skills, as I was on ``vacation'' in
      Los Angeles, California visiting my Mom, Dad, and Brother for the
      Thanksgiving Holiday. While in LA, a \textit{LOCKDOWN} order was in effect
      causing me to be unable to socialize or experience much of LA outside of
      my parent's house and food delivery and limited pick-up.

    In a way, the fact that everyone is wearing masks in public is sort of
      making nonverbal interpersonal communication skills more relevant than
      ever. I have never seen (or maybe I just did not notice prior to the
      pandemic) the level of expression people are able to convey with just
      the way they position their eyes and express other body language,
      especially without the ability to rely on noticing how somone positions
      their lips (smiling, frowning, afraid, shock, et cetera). Through just
      someones eyes it is easier for us to understand if and be empathetic
      towards their emotion be it happiness, sadness, or disgust, and
      exhaustion.
