      \texttt{[\ldots]}
      I, personally, don’t think my non-verbals give too much away when I am
        communicating. I am pretty good at keeping myself in check with my body
        language, and displaying that I am engaged in the conversation. I will
        say though, that a lot of the time when I am conversing with others, I
        tend to cross my arms. This is not because I am annoyed or
        disinterested, it is just a comfortable position for me, and one I
        resort to. However, this could be received negatively by the person I
        am having a conversation with, and make me come across as rude. I could
        definitely work on this more, so my non-verbals don’t say one thing,
        when I am actually feeling the opposite. One example of this was when I
        was speaking with my friend, I crossed my arms, but soon after I noticed
        a shift in his attitude. I realized that he probably got the impression
        that I was annoyed, angry, not interested in the conversation, or
        somewhere in between. I immediately changed my body language to show
        that I was in fact engrossed in the conversation.
